Small test programs for MOOC Git exercise. Timing of Arduino instructions and functions.

  Principle :
  1) Measure an empty for loop, using microsecondes time function.  
  2) Measure the desired instruction/block/function using the same for loop structure.  
  3) Print total time of the for loop and then the time taken by the included code (by subtracting the time for an
     empty for loop).
